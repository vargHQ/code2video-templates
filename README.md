# code2video templates

**Open-source video-as-code templates for AI agents.** Every folder in this repo turns a request into a finished MP4.
An agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Devin or any MCP client) reads the folder's `SKILL.md`, fills in the inputs and
renders. The code2video templates are HTML, Canvas, WebGL or Python, rendered locally with
[HyperFrames](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes), headless Chrome and ffmpeg: no API key, no credits. For AI
footage there are about 50 more templates in [`varg_jsx/`](varg_jsx/) that generate with Seedance, Kling, Veo,
nano-banana and ElevenLabs through [varg](https://varg.ai).

## Use it from an agent

Paste this into Claude Code, Codex or Cursor:

```text
Clone https://github.com/vargHQ/code2video-templates. Pick the template that fits my request from AGENTS.md,
read its SKILL.md, ask me for anything it needs, then render the video in the background.
My request: <what you want to see>
```

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is the index an agent reads first: every template, what it makes, its render command
  and whether it costs credits.
- Each template's `SKILL.md` is its instruction: inputs to collect, what to edit, how to render, how to check frames.
- In Claude Code the skills in [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/) load as soon as the repo is open.
- [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) lists the same for agents that read the web.

The workflow behind a 99 s, 36-shot anime music video, as an agent skill with scripts: a song map (beats, downbeats, word timings), a five-move story on the beat grid, character and location anchors, short Seedance scenes with QA, a frame-exact cut on the song, lyrics and graphics in HyperFrames, director rounds, and a small export for Telegram.

```bash
python3 varg-music-video/scripts/songmap.py assets/song.mp3 --lyrics lyrics.txt --out songmap.json
python3 varg-music-video/scripts/rough_cut.py storyboard.json place.json renders/cut.mp4 --clips out/ --audio assets/song.mp3

### `varg-previz/` -- three.js previz → Seedance video-to-video

<img src="https://s3.varg.ai/files/194b94d0-58ff-4e8b-91de-4f1959d04013/file_3a16e502c737.gif" width="480" alt="three.js grey-box previz next to the Seedance 2.5 result made from it">

Block every shot of a multi-shot video in a schematic 3D previz on the timeline (auto cameras from storyboard words, a posable mannequin, START/END camera editing), approve it, then export clean previz clips as `@video1` references and generate one short Seedance 2.5 video-to-video run per scene. Includes story structure, character sheet and scene grouping guides.

```bash
python3 varg-previz/scripts/new_previz.py ~/videos/my-ad --aspect 9:16
python3 ~/videos/my-ad/previz/serve.py   # http://localhost:8765/previz/
```

<img src="https://s3.varg.ai/files/194b94d0-58ff-4e8b-91de-4f1959d04013/file_6c082ea3d212.webp" width="480" alt="Liquid thorn logo: a black chrome word with thorns and barbed wire, smeared blue by a cursor">

Any word becomes a black-metal logo in glossy black chrome with thorns, horns and barbed wire. A cursor drags a WebGL fluid through it, so the letters smear and flood with colour, then settle back. Any size, a loopable clip, optional captions and music.

```bash
cd liquid-thorn-logo && bun install
bun render.ts --text "NOCTURNE" --size 1080x1920 --logo-only
```

See [`liquid-thorn-logo/README.md`](liquid-thorn-logo/README.md).

### `iphone-duo-fold/` -- iPhone Duo fold

Your screens on Apple's foldable iPhone, rendered in 3D. The cover shows while it's folded and the inner screen
when it's open, and the moving half blurs and darkens as it turns. Screens can be images, screen recordings, HTML
pages or URLs. Presets: unfold, fold, loop and reveal. Any size, an optional title, and MP4 or transparent ProRes/WebM out. Port of
[jadon7/iphone-duo](https://github.com/jadon7/iphone-duo) (MIT). Apple's AR model is downloaded on first run, never bundled.

```bash
cd iphone-duo-fold && bun install
bun render.ts --screen my-app.png --title "Meet Foldy" --size 1080x1920
```

See [`iphone-duo-fold/README.md`](iphone-duo-fold/README.md).

### `imessage-video/` -- iMessage video

<img src="https://s3.varg.ai/files/194b94d0-58ff-4e8b-91de-4f1959d04013/file_1982eaa83e5f.webp" width="720" alt="Three iMessage screens: a one-to-one chat with a sent screenshot, a dark-mode text story, a group chat with a link card">

A conversation written as JSON becomes a vertical video that looks like an iPhone screen recording of iMessage.
Replies show a typing indicator, your messages type out in the input bar, and bubbles, tapbacks, read receipts,
day dividers, photos, videos and link previews land like on iOS 26. One-to-one or group, light or dark, with
synthesized message sounds and an optional music bed. Reply timing comes from message length, so one `pace` value
sets the rhythm. For text stories, chat ads and skits.

```bash
cd imessage-video && bun install
bun render.ts examples/drama.json --sfx --size 1080x1920
```

See [`imessage-video/README.md`](imessage-video/README.md).

### `motion-studio-launch-film/` -- Motion Studio launch film

<a href="https://s3.varg.ai/files/60c50c05-1e93-46b9-ae75-47be786b4ff0/file_12540de8467b.mp4"><img src="https://s3.varg.ai/files/60c50c05-1e93-46b9-ae75-47be786b4ff0/file_accf745e09ee.png" width="640" alt="Motion Studio launch film: the varg how to guide for UGC ads in a dark product card"></a>

A 20-second, 60 fps launch film made from real screen captures by Opus 5.5 in Claude Code, following
[@beamnxw](https://x.com/beamnxw)'s Opus 5.5 Motion Studio Harness (eight stage files, MIT). The example shows a
search on varg how to: one captured state per typed character, a camera that follows the fitted screen, a cut on
the click, synthesized sound and a closing mark. Swap the captures, copy and event frames for your own product.

```bash
cd motion-studio-launch-film && bun install && bun run setup && bun run render   # out/final.mp4
```

See [`motion-studio-launch-film/README.md`](motion-studio-launch-film/README.md).

### `card-catalog-explainer/` -- Card catalog explainer

<a href="https://s3.varg.ai/files/194b94d0-58ff-4e8b-91de-4f1959d04013/file_18fb39ebfaa8.mp4"><img src="https://s3.varg.ai/files/194b94d0-58ff-4e8b-91de-4f1959d04013/file_40bf292107cb.webp" width="640" alt="Card catalog explainer: a wall of five code-made videos under the line Each one is a template an agent can run"></a>

Opens on five real renders from this repo, then follows one request through a library card catalog. An agent searches the drawer, pulls an index card and follows its call number to the source shelf. It installs from there and renders the mp4. Everything on screen comes from `config.json`, so it can explain any catalog, registry or marketplace. English by default, Russian in `examples/`.

```bash
cd card-catalog-explainer && bash make.command      # out/card-catalog-explainer-en.mp4
```

See [`card-catalog-explainer/README.md`](card-catalog-explainer/README.md).

## What code2video means here

The video is a program. HTML and CSS, a canvas, a WebGL shader, Python or JSX describe every frame, and a renderer
seeks through time and encodes the frames to MP4. The same input gives the same video. A template can be versioned,
diffed, forked and edited by an agent like any other code, and a cheap preview comes before the full render.

How this repo fits with other code2video tools:

| | This repo | Remotion | HyperFrames | Manim |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| You write | HTML/JS, Python or JSX | React | HTML + GSAP | Python |
| A template is | a folder that renders a finished video | a starter project | a block or component inside a composition | a scene |
| Agent instructions | a `SKILL.md` in every template | agent skills ([remotion-dev/skills](https://github.com/remotion-dev/skills)) | agent skills + registry | none built in |
| Generated footage | Seedance, Kling, Veo, ElevenLabs via varg | bring your own | HeyGen media | none |

HTML templates here render with HyperFrames, so its blocks and skills work inside them.

## AI-footage templates (`varg_jsx/`)

About 50 `.tsx` templates for the [varg SDK](https://github.com/vargHQ/sdk): Seedance ad formats, UGC and talking
heads, product videos, character montages and a 15-minute episode. They generate through the varg API with one
`VARG_API_KEY` and cost credits. Quick start, models and components: [`varg_jsx/README.md`](varg_jsx/README.md).

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/vargHQ/code2video-templates.git && cd code2video-templates && bun install
cp .env.example .env   # set VARG_API_KEY
bun run render varg_jsx/hello.tsx
```

## Add a template

One folder at the root, named after the template, on a `template/<name>` branch:

- `SKILL.md` with a `name` and a `description` that says what it makes, **Use when** and what it is not for;
- `README.md` for people, with a preview hosted on `s3.varg.ai` (never commit video, audio or images);
- the code and one command that renders it (`make.command`, `bun render.ts`, …);
- a link in `.claude/skills/<name>` → `../../<name>` and a row in `AGENTS.md`, `llms.txt` and this table.
